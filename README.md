# Elevio KB TypeScript starter

This repo provides a basis for your custom Elevio KB.

## Quick Start Guide

The best place to start is the [Quick Start Guide](https://kb-kit.elevio.help/en/articles/8).

## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dixahq/kb-typescript-starter.git
```

## `settings.json` file

This file gives you control over certain features in your Knowledge Base.

For detailed information on `settings.json` please visit our documentation: [ClientSettings](https://kb-kit.elevio.help/en/articles/81#clientsettings) and the [Quick Start Guide](https://kb-kit.elevio.help/en/articles/8)

You must ensure that you fill in an `accountId` in your `settings.json` file or the command line interface will fail when you try `npm run start`:

```shell
> npm run start
>
> @elevio/kb-javascript-starter@0.2.9 start
> elevio-kb dev

fetching settings
Missing company UID header
```

You can easily get your accountId from [app.elev.io/account](https://app.elev.io/account)

## .env

When you want to work on a KB you will also need to create a .env file in its repo. This file is git ignored so you will have to create it for each KB you work on.

There is an example `.env` file named `.env.example` in the root dir.

To get the TOKEN you you will need to log into HQ as the account of the company you want to publish a KB for. Then visit the URL https://app.elev.io/token and grab the Permanent key.

## Deploying / Previewing
